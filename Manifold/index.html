<h2>Introdution</h2>

<p>
    This era we are in has given birth to various innovations
 and generally everyone seeks to use the innovations to make things better for mankind.
Many were around when the latest technology of their time was first displayed,
 many saw it as a waste of time,
many saw that it wouldn't work and few believed in it to the point they invested massively into it.
</p>
<p>Now what is the latest innovation of the 21st century that is
    making waves as at this point of writing this whitepaper you might be asking?
    The simple answer is <span style="color:blue; font-size: larger;" >BLOCKCHAIN.</span><br>
    Since the very  first blockchain 
   and Cryptocurrency was built this has caused a massive roar
    to the way people think and do things.<br> 
   Like a spark in the forest which led to the outright forest fire,
    that was exactly what the founder of Bitcoin did to the world, 
   he started an innovation which has changed
    the lives of billions all over the world.<br>
    Each year many have seen how dynamic the whole ecosystem is
    and everyone knowing its potential is trying to one way
    or another use it for the greater good of the world population.</p></div>
    <div style="background-color:green; color:white; padding: 5px;">
    <h2>
        PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>
        Despite many knowing  what Blockchain is,
        its use cases and how it can really change how we humans do things.<br>
        Yet 90% of blockchain use cases are still focused on the financial aspect of blockchain
        which is cryptocurrencies and the financial freedom it brings.<br>
        Knowing fully well that the use case of blockchain is endless,
        why should we just focus on only one aspect and neglecting the others.<br>
        One of the major reasons still delaying mass adoption of blockchain technology is the fact that blockchain
        has been polished to suit the financial needs of the populace,<br>
        making them look like a glorified scheme and the government
        seeing it as a threat to an already established system that has existed for several hundreds of years.</p>
       
      <p> Many fail to realise that blockchain is the next evolution of the internet
        and evolution can't be stopped but can only be delayed,
        sooner or later massive adoption of blockchain will occur
        and useful use cases will be the bulk of such adoption.

    <h2>WHAT IS <span style="color:green;">MANIFOLD</span></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Manifold</strong> is derived from an ancient English text meaning multiple.<br>
 Manifold is a product of individuals who see blockchain
 as an entity which can be malleable to bring out the best out of it if used appropriately.<br>
 The whole idea of manifold is to create an ecosystem
 whereby adoption of blockchain will begin from the grassroot,
 an ecosystem that will drive productivity from the land,
 reduce product wastage and promote acquisition of skills which will make one independent in life.<br>

Manifold plan is to drive adoption so that blockchain
 will be an indispensable entity to government, companies 
and individuals and will cause growth not only in the economy but in all spheres of life.<br>


Manifold is a blockchain platform built on the biggest web3 blockchain 
<span style="color:red; font-size: larger;">NEAR-PROTOCOL</span>
in order to drive utility to blockchain as a whole
 and erase the mentality of uselessness of blockchain and bring about simplicity of the whole ecosystem.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color:green; color:white; padding: 5px;">
    <p>
        <h2>MISSION & GOALS OF MANIFOLDS</h2>
Our mission is to aid first adoption of the blockchain everywhere in the world.<br>
The primary goals of manifold is to enhance the already
 created structure in terms of NFT,
 DEFI, LEARN TO EARN AND CURRENT COMMERCIAL SECTOR.<br> 
Currently we have more than 100+ platforms built on various blockchains
 with a promise to revolutionise these various sectors
 and make web3 more available with more interesting
 use cases<br> but many haven't been actualized that is why MANIFOLDS is here.<br>
 The current goals includes:
   <ul>
    
        <li><p>Creating an NFT marketplace that is fully decentralised,
            available on various ecosystems thanks to interoperability of the NEAR BLOCKCHAIN
            and hard to be manipulated thanks to the secured infrastructure already available on the NEAR ecosystem.
            The manifolds marketplace will host NFTs of various projects built on various ecosystems
            like what we see on SPORES NETWORK but with a different twist.
            At manifolds we would reach out to the younger ecosystem,
            create a marketplace,
            marketing structure for these NFT projects and increase their user base.
            Also manifolds marketplace with house manifolds native NFTs
            which would be access key to the other products that will be launched in MANIFOLDS ecosystem.</p></li>
        <li><p>Looking at the various commonly used DEFI projects we can certainly say
            that many aren't interested in long term sustainability
            but are much more interested in massive APY, TVL and drawing up
            large investors who comes in and empty the already reserved stores,
            leading to many of these projects going bankrupt and reporting rugpull.
            At manifolds we look at Defi as a replacement to the current financial
            sector by creating a type of DEFI2.0 as we create an ecosystem
            that operates like an evolved physical bank by creating measures by
            which funds can be invested in vaults with a working business attached to it,
            creating an APY which is feasible for the long run
            and making the number of vaults well spread with each vaults having a maximum
            each wallet holder can put in, thereby preventing whales manipulation and sudden drop in APY.</p></li>
        <li><p>Current Learn to earn platforms are very few and  spread across BSC, ETH and the latest POLYGON.
            The current situation of events especially during this post COVID 19 era has led to positions
            and opportunities opened to people who have various types of skills
            and many of these learn to earn platforms fail to realise that people are in search of platforms
            that will make them learn a new skill and put it to test.
            The learn to earn platform will focus on both soft skills and physical skills acquisition
            targeting individuals from 16 to 35yrs of age.
            Our focus isn't on just creating a platform for just learning and getting skills,
            we would focus on connecting skill sets to persons,
            companies and platforms who would need such skills to increase their productivity.</p></li>    
        <li><p>Decentralised commerce platforms are very new in the blockchain space and not really looked into.
            We at MANIFOLDS we see that to propagate adoption of web3 we need to make many aspect of human endeavour DECENTRALISED
            that is why manifold has decided to take it upon itself to improve the the commercial sector by creating a platform,
            whereby commercial activities can go on smoothly without a third party.
            Platform where regulations that won't suffocate parties involved and finally creating a secured commercial platforms,
            whereby personal information of parties involved are kept safe encrypted on NEAR blockchain and fraud is generally reduced.</p></li>    
        </ul>
             
             <p>MANIFOLDS is an ecosystem comprising of:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>NFTs</li>
                    <li>DEFI AND MULTIDEX</li>
                    <li>LEARN TO EARN</li>
                    <li>DECENTRALISED COMMERCE</li>

    <div style="background-color:white; color:green; padding: 5px;">
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">DETAILS OF MANIFOLDS ECOSYSTEM</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>NFT AND ITS MARKET PLACE</strong>
      <br>  
The first product that will be unleashed into the manifolds ecosystem is the NFT marketplace.<br>
This NFT marketplace of manifolds will involve two types of markets,
 the first will be a marketplace for native manifolds NTFs
 while the second will be the marketplace for secondary projects of manifolds partners
 or projects decided by the community.<br>
 Our native manifolds nfts which will be a total of 10000 copies,
 the first which will be a total of 5000 copies will be tradable
 and give buffers to the second types of manifold ntfs which form the core of manifold ecosystem.<br>
 The nature of the set is very unique because it will be the bedrock of the learn to earn product.<br>
 Our native manifolds NFTs are actually the ticket to access various upcoming products to be
 launched on the manifolds ecosystem,
 especially the learn to earn, decentralised commerce and streaming platform.<br>
 These first set of special NFTs once owned give access to the holders discount rate,
 free <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">$MANI</span> and special access to other upcoming platforms,
 in the long run more utility will be added to the native NFTs as decided by the community.<br></p>
<p> The second set of native NFTs won't be bought and owned by individuals or companies but by the
 manifolds corporation and will only be leased out based on agreement between manifold team and
 the individual interested after fulfilling some terms of agreement.<br>
 Manifolds will be the first to implement such which thereby reduces volatility in price
 of some native NFTs as all native NFTs will have the same leasing price based on product
 and level, also it won't be affected by demand of some native NFTs over the other.<br>
 Secondary market NFTs can be bought and sold in our marketplace based on community decisions
 and partnerships with other secondary market places
 and there are plans of creating cross chains with massive NFTs markets across well known blockchains.
    </p>
    <br>
    <P>
       <strong>DEFI AND MULTIDEX</strong>  
       <br>
 Defi became an important strata of the whole cryptosphere especially in 2020 and year 2021.<br>
 Over the coming year, DeFi had taken a whole new revolution in providing services that conventional financial institutions couldn't provide.<br>
 Yield farming and lending protocols has become a major bulk of the DeFi ecosystem and this has seen the inception of large amounts
  of money being thrown into such protocols and this has also created a breeding environment for scam projects to grow
   and draw in greedy investors which eventually lead to the downfall of the project.<br>
   <br>
 At Manifolds we intend on making the DeFi ecosystem profitable for long term investors and those wishing to enjoy
  a solid use case on blockchain,<br> 
 we aren't promising high yield farms or pools, but we assure everyone of sustainability and a redefinition of what DeFi means.<br>
 Manifolds will be unleashing the era of DEFI2.0 whereby sustainability farms
 and vaults are attached to physical business of our decentralised commerce platform whereby returns are based on percentage
 of profit made plus the return for staking our <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">$MANI</span> token.<br>
 Manifolds native token <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">$MANI</span> will be the core token of this ecosystem
 and will be used as the currency to operate various services in this ecosystem,<br>
 a certain % of the total supply of <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;">$MANI</span> has been allocated to this product including reduction mechanisms such as burning
 will be activated to ensure sustainability of this product.</P>
 <p>On the initial release of the manifold project the core team will create initial liquidity on ref finance
 and open a staking pool for Early holders of the $MANI token.<br>
 As other products of this ecosystem start to be actualized,
 staking pools for some special  types of NFTs such as certificates,<br>
 club membership and accomplishments badges will be created
 and peopl will earn them as return of investment for their time and money spent on the platform.
 The multidex will be created to not only serve the defi aspect of manifolds
 but to also allow for quick swap of transfer of ownership of secondary market NFTs,
 goods & services,
 and other as suggested by the community as there is no end to what the multidex will be able to do as the community
 will be able to have a say in functionalities of the multidex.<br>
 To accomplish this product partnership within the NEAR ecosystem is crucial and this will be supported by decision from the community.

    <div style="background-color:green; color:white; padding: 5px;">
    <P>
       <strong>LEARN TO EARN</strong> 
<br>
Knowing the full potential of blockchain,
the Manifold team decided to create a potential use case that will benefit lots of people both in developed and developing countries.
 The whole idea here is to create a platform whereby people that possess
 skills both formal and informal can be able to teach people who are interested
 in learning such skills at a  particular fee and also to connect such skill
 holders to end users who need them for their services either full time or part time.<br>
 Manifolds seeks to be this platform that will connect these three sets of individuals
 and will create an opportunity for owners of these skills based on experience to market their skills.</P> 

<p>Through this platform students/learners have the power to rate their teachers
 within the time frame of their training and give a full evaluation and recommendations of their teachers.
 All these will be made public and attached to the teachers profile.<br> One of the long term plans  of manifolds
 is to give out certificates based on completion of courses which will be in the form of NFTs
 that will grant holders special benefits in the Manifolds ecosystem.
 This platform will enable individuals and companies to find the right skill sets needed for productivity in their companies.</P>

<p>Compared to other Learn to Earn platforms where the sole aim is to educate people about blockchain
 and its opportunities and then reward a certain set of winners.<br>
 At manifolds we empower by bringing opportunities present in the physical to blockchain
 and using such opportunities to bring about adoption.<br>
 The opportunities opened for the initial start will be skills related to marketing,
 operations and product development, as the platform gets more popular
 we would extend to include certificate programs including diploma recognised by international bodies
 as we plan to partner with various online educational platforms such as coursera and udemy.<br>
  The current system put in place is to create a learn to earn platform that will create an avenue for instructors to market themselves,
 projects to see best of skill sets to employ and promote online training.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>DECENTRALISED COMMERCE</strong>
                    <br>

                    Many centralised commercial apps such as amazon, jumia, alibaba
                     and others have over the time become inefficient especially in terms of data security,
                     KYC of users and tracking of goods bought/sold through their platforms.<br>
                     To solve the various inefficiencies surrounding centralised commerce especially in developing countries all over the world,
                     Manifolds has decided to use blockchain as the foundation in building its own decentralised commercial platform.<br>
                     The concept here is to use blockchain to keep users information,
                     track goods bought/sold through the platform,
                     enable actions when there is failure in delivery or payment of Goods
                     and finally remove bottlenecks in our traditional commercial sectors.<br>
                     This will enable individuals, companies and governments to keep track various commercial
                     activities going on within a particular geographical area.<br>
                     The team plan is to make the decentralised commerce platform partly centralised and bring in legal entities.
                     Along the line as trust is being built by end users of this platform,
                     regular well known traders with high trust scores will be given a verified
                     ticker which will give them some decentralised benefits.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another untapped benefit of blockchain is in the agricultural sector where there is always
                     issues involving farmers lacking funds to do commercial<br> farming especially of cash crops,
                     poor storage of farm yields and poor markets place for their farm yields.<br> 
                    Manifold plans to use the power of blockchain to provide solutions to the
                     agricultural sector by creating a platform whereby farmers can seek for investment funds
                     either by asking for loans or partnering with investors willing to give them the
                     needed funds to make their farm lands productive.<br> Also Via this platform farmers can
                     advertise their farm yields at various stages of development and get in touch with marketplaces,
                     individuals and companies wishing to buy the yields of the farm at favourable prices.<br>
                     The whole idea is to create a platform connecting farmers, investors and marketplaces
                     where there is an envisioned plan to increase the use case of this platform as the community seem fit.
        </p>
<br>
<!-- <p>
<strong>STREAMING PLATFORM</strong>
<br>
    MANIFOLDS would also bring into the ecosystem an operation that allows live streaming of videos and audio.<br> 
    In the decentralized world, many have contemplated how good it would be to be able to stream their songs
     and movies through the power of the blockchain since the world is moving into the web 3,
     a lot of payments would also change directions to payment by cryptocurrency.<br> 
    Instead of their normal local currency, people would be able to stream videos and audio with the <span style="color:blue ;">$MANI</span> token. 
    This would in turn bring more value to the Manifolds ecosystem.

            <strong>BLOCKCHAIN MANIFOLDS IS BUILT ON</strong>
            <br>
            Knowing fully well that the Manifold ecosystem comprises of five units,
            the blockchain on which this platform is to be built on has to be considered
            especially when looking at the complexity of the idea, increase user base,
            promotion of web 3 solution, NFTs and DeFI and a need for an all evolving
             ecosystems that wills support and promote platforms built on it the first choice is NEAR protocol.</p>
            Many may be asking knowing fully well that popular block chains such as etherium,
             solana and others can be used.
              Why <strong style="color:gold ;">NEAR-PROTOCOL?</strong>
            
              <P>The NEAR blockchain after extensive research by the team has been found out to be the blockchain
             in which the whole idea of Manifold can be built on in terms of supporting ecosystems,
             promotion of web 3 and a seamless user base experience.</p>
            
                    Through simple, secure, and scalable technology, NEAR-PROTOCOL empowers millions to invent
