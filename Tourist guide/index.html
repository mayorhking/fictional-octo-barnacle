    <h2>Volcanos National Park</h2>
    <h5>Rwanda</h5>
    <p>
        While most African hinterlands away from the Great Rift Valley are forced to compete with the likes of Kruger and Maasai Mara, Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, when it comes to the wild, mist-topped backcountry of Rwanda’s Volcanos National Park, all bets are off! Yep, this truly breathtaking conservation area – contiguous with Virunga across the border – is topped by the once-smoking calderas of mighty mounts like Karisimbi and serrated Sabyinyo.

All around these craggy volcanic peaks, visitors discover lush montane forests and thick groves of African redwoods.

    <h2>Maasai Mara</h2>
    <h5>Kenya</h5>
    <P>
        Maasai Mara, also sometimes spelled Masai Mara and locally known simply as The Mara, is a large national game reserve in Narok, Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.<br> It is named in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral inhabitants of the area, who migrated to the area from the Nile Basin. Their description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means "spotted" in the local Maasai language, due to the many short bushy trees which dot the landscape.

    <h2>Mosque of Ibn Tulun</h2>
    <h5>Egypt</h5>
    <p>
        Built between 876 and 879 AD, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is one of the oldest mosques in Cairo.<br> It was commissioned by Ahmad ibn Ţūlūn, the Abbassid governor of Egypt. The mosque is constructed around a courtyard, with one covered hall on each of the four sides.<br> The minaret, which features a helical outer staircase similar to that of the famous minaret in Samarra, was probably built several centuries later.<br> Parts of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me were filmed at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun.
